- 👋 Hi, I’m @ssheth01
- 👀 I’m interested in general software development, and continuously love to learn new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Raspberry PI development, hardware integration. I primarily come from a Microsft .NET background, and have developed numerous solutions based on that.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, currently, hardware/software integration for various railway and security solutions.
- 📫 How to reach me via GitHub... More to follow later.
